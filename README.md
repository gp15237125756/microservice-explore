# microservice-explore

## description
I have used   `Apache Dubbo` as working framework for a decade months,the explore is essential to migrate into `Spring Cloud`.
Basically,the project will cover spring-cloud-eureka,spring-cloud-config etc. so as to properly migrate when it is nessary.
As a result,the project aims at the ` basic framework for distribute system`.
